# KubeRay integration with MCAD (Multi-Cluster-App-Dispatcher)

The multi-cluster-app-dispatcher is a Kubernetes controller providing mechanisms for applications to manage batch jobs in a single or multi-cluster environment. For more details please refer [here](https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher).

## Use case

MCAD allows you to deploy Ray cluster with a guarantee that sufficient resources are available in the cluster prior to actual pod creation in the Kubernetes cluster. It supports features such as:
   
- Integrates with upstream Kubernetes scheduling stack for features such co-scheduling, Packing on GPU dimension etc.
- Ability to wrap any Kubernetes objects.
- Increases control plane stability by JIT (Just-in Time) object creation.
- Queuing with policies.
- Quota management that goes across namespaces.
- Support for multiple Kubernetes clusters; dispatching jobs to any one of a number of Kubernetes clusters.


In order to queue Ray cluster(s) and `gang dispatch` them when aggregated resources are available please refer to the setup [KubeRay-MCAD integration](https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher/blob/quota-management/doc/usage/examples/kuberay/kuberay-mcad.md) with configuration files [here](https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher/tree/quota-management/doc/usage/examples/kuberay/config).

## Submitting KubeRay cluster to MCAD

Let's submit two Ray clusters on the same Kubernetes cluster.

- Assuming you have installed all the pre-requisites mentioned in the [KubeRay-MCAD integration](https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher/blob/quota-management/doc/usage/examples/kuberay/kuberay-mcad.md), we submit the first Ray cluster using command `kubectl create -f aw-raycluster.yaml` using config file [here](https://github.com/IBM/multi-cluster-app-dispatcher/blob/quota-management/doc/usage/examples/kuberay/config/aw-raycluster.yaml).

```

- As seen the cluster is dispatched and pods are running.

- Let's submit another Ray cluster and see it queued without creating pending pods using the command `kubectl create -f aw-raycluster.yaml`. To do this, change cluster name from `name: raycluster-autoscaler` to `name: raycluster-autoscaler-1` and re-submit

- As seen the second Ray cluster is queued with no pending pods created. 

- Dispatching policy out of the box is FIFO which can be augmented as per user needs. The second cluster will be dispatched when additional aggregated resources are available in the cluster or the first AppWrapper Ray cluster is deleted.
