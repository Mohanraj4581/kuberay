# Ray Kubernetes Operator

KubeRay operator makes deploying and managing Ray clusters on top of Kubernetes painless - clusters are defined as a custom RayCluster resource and managed by a fault-tolerant Ray controller.
The Ray Operator is a Kubernetes operator to automate provisioning, management, autoscaling and operations of Ray clusters deployed to Kubernetes.

![overview](media/overview.png)

Some of the main features of the operator are:
- Management of first-class RayClusters via a [custom resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources).
- Support for heterogenous worker types in a single Ray cluster.
- Built-in monitoring via Prometheus.
- Use of `PodTemplate` to create Ray pods
- Updated status based on the running pods
- Events added to the `RayCluster` instance
- Automatically populate `environment variables` in the containers
- Automatically prefix your container command with the `ray start` command
- Automatically adding the volumeMount at `/dev/shm` for shared memory
- Use of `ScaleStartegy` to remove specific nodes in specific groups

## Overview

When deployed, the ray operator will watch for K8s events (create/delete/update) for the `raycluster` resources. The ray operator can create a raycluster (head + multipe workers), delete a cluster, or update the cluster by adding or removing worker pods.

### Ray cluster creation

Once a `raycluster` resource is created, the operator will configure and create the ray-head and the ray-workers specified in the `raycluster` manifest as shown below.

### Ray cluster Update

You can update the number of replicas in a worker goup, and specify which exact replica to remove by updated the raycluster resource manifest:

### Ray cluster example code

An example ray code is defined in this [configmap](msft-operator/ray-operator/config/samples/config-map-ray-code.yaml) that is mounted into the ray head-pod. By examining the logs of the head pod, we can see the list of the IP addresses of the nodes that joined the ray cluster:

### Deploy the operator

```shell
kubectl apply -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/ray-operator/config/default"
```

Check that the controller is running.
```shell
$ kubectl get deployments -n ray-system
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ray-operator   1/1     1            1           40s

$ kubectl get pods -n ray-system
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ray-operator-75dbbf8587-5lrvn   1/1     Running   0          31s
```

Delete the operator
```shell
kubectl delete -k "github.com/ray-project/kuberay/ray-operator/config/default"
```

### Running an example cluster

There are three example config files to deploy RayClusters included here:

Sample  | Description
------------- | -------------
[ray-cluster.mini.yaml](config/samples/ray-cluster.mini.yaml)   | Small example consisting of 1 head pod.
[ray-cluster.heterogeneous.yaml](config/samples/ray-cluster.heterogeneous.yaml)  | Example with heterogenous worker types. 1 head pod and 2 worker pods, each of which has a different resource quota.
[ray-cluster.complete.yaml](config/samples/ray-cluster.complete.yaml)  | Shows all available custom resouce properties.

```shell
# Create a configmap with a hello world Ray code.
kubectl create -f config/samples/config-map-ray-code.yaml
configmap/ray-code created
```


```shell
# Create a cluster.
$ kubectl create -f config/samples/ray-cluster.heterogeneous.yaml
raycluster.ray.io/raycluster-heterogeneous created

# List running clusters.
$ kubectl get rayclusters
NAME                AGE
raycluster-heterogeneous   2m48s

# The created cluster should include a head pod, worker pod, and a head service.
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
raycluster-heterogeneous-head-5r6qr                  1/1     Running   0          14m
raycluster-heterogeneous-worker-medium-group-ljzzt   1/1     Running   0          14m
raycluster-heterogeneous-worker-small-group-76qxb    1/1     Running   0          14m
raycluster-heterogeneous-worker-small-group-dcl4d    1/1     Running   0          14m
```

```shell
$ kubectl get services
NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes                        ClusterIP   10.152.183.1   <none>        443/TCP   35d
raycluster-heterogeneous-my-svc   ClusterIP   None           <none>        80/TCP    15m
```

The logs of the head pod should show 4 nodes in the Ray cluster
```
Ray Nodes:  {'10.1.73.139', '10.1.73.138', '10.1.73.140', '10.1.73.141'}
```

```shell
