# Contributing Guidelines

Read the following guide if you're interested in contributing to ray operator project.

## Finding Things That Need Help

If you're new to the project and want to help, but don't know where to start, we have a semi-curated list of issues that should not need deep knowledge of the system. Have a look and see if anything sounds interesting. If the issue has been assigned, reach out to the assignee. Alternatively, read some of the docs on other controllers and try to write your own, file and fix any/all issues that come up, including gaps in the documentation!

## Contributing a Patch

1. Clone the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
2. Submit a pull request.

All changes must be code reviewed. We don't have clear coding conventions and standards now, try to `gofmt` your code before check in. 
Expect reviewers to request that you avoid common [go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

## Features and bugs
